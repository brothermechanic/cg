# @SUPPORTED_EAPIS: 7 8
# @BLURB: An eclass for OpenVDB to control which ABI version is compiled
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The OpenVDB package is a library for sorting and manipulating sparse
# data structures with dynamic topology as required for use in volume
# rendering for computer graphics.
#
# Each major version of OpenVDB provides an updated ABI, as well as
# the ability to compile using a legacy version of the ABI.
# Openvdb 7 can be compiled to support version 5, 6 or 7 of the ABI.
#
# However the user needs to choose at compile time which version to
# build by passing OPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER="5" to cmake.
# It is not possible to support multiple versions concurrently
# so OpenVDB and all packages depending upon it must be built for the
# same ABI version. This currently means blender and openvdb, and
# will also include >=openimageio-2.0 once it is updated
#
# The client packages have differing requirements for the ABI support.
# For example,
# Openvdb-7 supports 5-7 (older version provide ABI 3 and 4 support)
# Blender supports ABI 4-7
# Openimageio-2.0 supports ABI 5-7.
#
# To use this eclass, the user should first select which ABI to build
# and set OPENVDB_ABI USE_EXPAND variable in make.conf.
#
# When the client package inherits this eclass, it can use the
# OPENVDB_COMPAT variable in the ebuild to specify which ABI it
# supports, and then use the OPENVDB_SINGLE_USEDEP variable that the
# eclass produces to force the package to link using ABI selected in
# OPENVDB_ABI
# eg. openvdb? ( media-gfx/openvdb[${OPENVDB_SINGLE_USEDEP}] )
# When OPENVDB_COMPAT="X Y" the variable evaluates to
# openvdb_abi_X(-)? openvdb_abi_Y(-)?
#
# The client can pass the ABI version to the build system as follows:
# append-cppflags -DOPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER="${OPENVDB_ABI}"
#
# This eclass includes pkg_setup which ensures that the package will
# only compile if only one openvdb_abi_X USE flag is set
#
# @EXAMPLE:
# The user needs to choose which version of the ABI supports all packages
# they plan to install. This is then stored in a variable in make.conf
# eg. OPENVDB_ABI="5" in /etc/portage/make.conf
#
# The client packages need to:
# - inherit this eclass.
# - list the ABI supported by the package in OPENVDB_COMPAT.
# - use OPENVDB_REQUIRED_USE to ensure that only one of the
#   compatible ABI can be selected by the ebuild.
# - include OPENVDB_SINGLE_USEDEP in RDEPEND to ensure any
#   dependencies build against a similar ABI.
# - pass the OPENVDB_ABI version to the package build system
#
# @CODE
# inherit openvdb
# OPENVDB_COMPAT=( 4 5 6 7 )
# REQUIRED_USE="openvdb? ( ${OPENVDB_REQUIRED_USE} )"
# RDEPEND="openvdb? ( media-gfx/openvdb[${OPENVDB_SINGLE_USEDEP}] )"
#
# src_configure() {
#   append-cppflags -DOPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER="${OPENVDB_ABI_VERSION}"

# This variable contains a list of OpenVDB ABI the package supports.

# This is an eclass generated USE-dependency flag which can be used by

# support is built.
#
# Example use:
# @CODE
# RDEPEND="openvdb? ( media-gfx/openvdb[${OPENVDB_SINGLE_USEDEP}] )"

# @CODE
